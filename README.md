# SMB3 For Super Players
Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels remake in Super Mario Bros. 3 using Super Mario Bros. 3 Mix' code with the NoDice editor. Thanks to captain southbird for the code and the editor. https://github.com/captainsouthbird

To assemble this game, simply run:
nesasm smb3fsp.asm

Files for NoDice are not included. (except for game.xml lol, because this file could be important.)
Please configure NoDice yourself if you want to edit the game with it.

**ASM6 not supported.**

Have fun. :)
